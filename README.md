# Exchange-Rate-Forecasting-with-News-Data

In Exchange Rate Forecasting with News Data Project value of USD/TL is forecastedfor next day.
News about economy and economic parameters is used with deeplearning algorithms. 
The scope of the this project is mining of news data, fixing the
data with natural language processing algorithms and using the fixed data in deep
learning algorithms together with other economic parameters to forecast the next day’s
exchange rate estimation.

I took news headlines from Twitter with twipy. I worked with Turkish data. String libraries can't work without English well. I prepared my funcs for this part.
I used dollar's daily change. After prepare news and daily change, I merge this datas to use LSTM. I used Keras for LSTM. 

In the end of project, a program is prepared for showing
results to user. User can see last news and current exchange rate with this progIn Exchange Rate Forecasting with News Data Project value of USD/TL is forecasted
